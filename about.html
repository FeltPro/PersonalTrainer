           <h2>Personal Trainer Bristol</h2>
           <p style="margin-top: 40px">
             Hi, my name is Lydia and I qualified as personal trainer in August 2021. For years Iâ€™ve been dreaming of becoming a Personal Trainer and when lock down hit, I took it as an opportunity to study and qualify.  I have always been active and passionate about fitness and striving to become the best version of me!  Exercise makes me happy, gives me energy and confidence. Over the last four years I  have participated in long distance cycling events, sprint distance triathlons and a half marathon. I love seeing others transform both mentally and physically.
            </p>
             <p>
             The Personal Training service I provide is not only during the session, but rather a coaching service throughout your journey to achieve your goals. When you sign up with me, you will get regular contact to see how you're getting on, nutritional advice, tailored plans and advice on progress.
             </p>
             <p>
             My main area of expertise is strength and conditioning, which when corporated correctly into a plan and at the right time, provides huge benefits to the three disciplines of Triathlon.
            </p>
            <p>
            All one-to-one personal training is tailored to your needs and goals. I offer tailored training to clients of all levels and abilities. My aim is to help clients build confidence and strength to go on to achieve and maintain the best version of you! I encourage and motivate you when you need it with personalised advice on diet and lifestyle, or adjusting your training programme to suit your individual needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I offer tailored training plans when you sign up to a Personal Training package for goals such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strength training</li>
              <li>Specific fat loss goals </li>
              <li>Specific aesthetic goals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Service I provide is through:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>One to one training</li>
              <li>Training for small groups (2-4 people) </li>
              <li>Fitness classes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Strength and Conditioning classes at Frame and Form in Warmley every Wednesday at 7pm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learn to Lift fitness classes every Monday at 7am and Saturday at 9:30am at Imperial Sports Ground in Brislington.
